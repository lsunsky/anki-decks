# Anki decks I've created
[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) is an awesome program for studying flashcards using spaced repetition -- a study method [proven](https://info.maths.ed.ac.uk/assets/files/LandT/what_works_what_doesnt.pdf) highly effective.

Each .apkg file is an Anki deck; currently each deck corresponds to a course I've taken.
